# Comments, which are created using # symbol, allow for the interpreter to
# ignore that text. It will not be considered part of the program
# Comments are intended to make confusing code easier to understand for other
# programmers
# Comments should not be abused. You shouldn't overuse comments to explain
# every single line of code.
# Rule of thumb: Code should be easily self-explanatory as much as possible to
# other developers

# Variables allow you to store different values
# For example, we create a variable with the name abc (abc is our identifier)
# and we assign it a value of 100
abc = 100
print(abc)
abc = "hello"  # str
print(abc)

x = 10  # int
y = 20.0  # float
print(x)
print(y)

print(abc)  # hello
print("hello")  # hello

# Datatypes
print(type(abc))  # Should print out "<class 'str'>"
print(type(x))  # Should print out "<class 'int'>"
print(type(y))  # Should print out "<class 'float'>"
