# Week 1 Friday Exercise 1

Exercise: 
1. Create a function that takes in a list containing numbers (ints or floats) and returns the sum of all of the numbers
2. Use PyTest and create unit test cases and execute those test cases and see if they pass

Steps:
1. Create a folder that will contain the Python project and also have a virtual environment generated for this project
    - `source venv/Scripts/activate` to enter the virtual environment
    - `pip install pytest` to install PyTest inside the virtual environment
2. Implement the function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of numbers
    - Create a .py file that contains the function
3. Create another .py file (with test_ at the beginning) that will contain the test cases that you write
4. Write various test cases for the function
5. Run the test cases using the `pytest -v` command in the command line
    - Make sure all test cases are passing
