# Steps each team should complete
As a team, you must
* Decide a project idea to design and implement
* Have a name for your project (this will show up on your portfolio, so have a good name!)
* Have a description for the project (this will show up on your portfolio, so have a good description!)
* Have several user stories formatted in the format `As a <user description>, I want <functionality>, so that <benefit>`

Please create a document containing the above information and have someone from the team email it to me. After that, I can do a quick review of the project idea and give an all clear for the project or whether more clarifications need to be made
