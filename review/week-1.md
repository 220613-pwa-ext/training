# Week 1 Review

* Python
    - Interpreted
        - Python programs run using an interpreter
        - An interpreter is a piece of software that will read the code line by line AS THE PROGRAM IS RUNNING and translate it into something that the computer will understand
        - Compiler v. Interpreter
            - Compilers translate source code into lower-level code that will later be executed
            - Interpreters translate source code into lower-level code that gets executed while the program is running
    - High-level
        - Easy for humans to understand and read/write
        - Programming languages that are high level allow for greater productivity, more people to become developers, etc.
    - Dynamic
        - Variables are able to store many different types of data
        - You can change what type of data a variable is storing
    - Strongly-typed
        - All conversions from one datatype to another must be explicit
        - `print('number: ' + str(5))`
* Python Interpreter
    - Many different versions
        - CPython
            - Written in C
            - Official "reference" interpreter
            - Found whenever you installed Python from python.org
        - JPython
            - Written in Java
        - IronPython
            - Written in C#
    - Structure
        - Just-in-time compiler (JIT)
            - Translates Python code into "byte-code"
        - Virtual Machine
            - Executes the byte-code
            - Translates byte-code into machine code that the computer can execute
* History of Python
    - Created by Guido Van Rossum
        - Designed the idea of the Python programming language in the 1980s
        - The first implementation was created in 1991
    - Versions
        - Python 2
            - Legacy version of Python
            - A lot of companies still use Python 2 programs
            - Different syntax than Python 3
        - Python 3
            - Current version of Python
            - Not backwards compatible with Python 2
            - All existing Python 2 code would need to be updated by developers to be able to run within the Python 3 ecosystem
* Git
    - Version control system
    - Used for managing versions of a project
        - These versions are known as commits
    - Project structure
        - Working directory
            - Containing all of the files you are actually working with in your project
        - .git folder
            - Staging area
                - Files from the working directory are added to the staging area using `git add`
            - Local repository
                - Files from the staging area are committed to the local repository using `git commit`
        - Remote repository
            - Exists in another location
                - Ex. Github, Gitlab, BitBucket, SourceForge
            - Changes from the local repository can be pushed to the remote repository using `git push`
    - Git commands
        - `git init`
            - Initialize a new local repository
        - `git remote`
            - Used to configure remote repositories that the local repository should be linked to
            - ex. `git remote add origin <link>`
        - `git log`
            - Display the history of commits
        - `git reset`
            - Rollback to previous commits
        - `git clone`
            - Clones the remote repository to your computer and creates a local repository
        - `git pull`
            - "Pulls the latest changes from the remote repository to the local repository"
            - Combination of two commands
                - `git fetch`
                - `git merge`
        - `git fetch`
            - Download the changes made from the remote repository
            - Does not affect the working directory
        - `git merge`
            - Merging changes from one branch into another branch
        - `git checkout`
            - Switching the branch that you are on
        - `git branch`
            - Create a new branch
        - Typical Git workflow
            - `git status`
            - `git add`
            - `git commit`
            - `git push`
* IDEs
    - Integrated development environment

    - `+=`
    - `-=`
    - `*=`

* Statement v. Expression
    - Statement: a line of code that does something
    - Expression: a piece of code that evaluates to a single value
        - ex. `2 + 2`
        - ex. `addition(2, 2)`
        - ex. `10`
        - ex. `addition(2, 3) + 5`
        - ex. `addition(addition(2, 3), addition(3, 5))`
    - All expressions can be statements, but not all statements can be expressions
* Functions
    - A block of code that can be executed over and over
        - Reusable
    - The code does not run unless you invoke the function
    - `def <function name>(): `
    - Functions can be defined with parameters
        - Parameters represent values that can be passed into the function when the function is invoked
        - "Input"
    - Functions can also return values
        - `return` keyword
        - "Output"
        - If your function has no return keyword, it will return `None`
            - `print(print("Hello world"))` -> `print(None)`
    - Parameters v. Arguments
        - Parameters are the variables that are defined for the function that maps to the inputs into the function
        - ex. `def some_func(x, y):`
            - x and y are parameters
        - Arguments: what you actually pass, or input into the function whenever you invoke the function
            - ex. `some_func(10, 20)`
                - 10 and 20 are arguments that map to the parameters x and y
