# Week 5
* HTML
    - HyperText Markup Language
    - Current version is HTML5
        - `<!DOCTYPE html>` used to define that a particular document is HTML5
    - Defines the structure of a webpage
    - Consists of HTML elements
        - Elements are defined using `tags`
        - Elements can be nested inside of other elements (parent - child relationships)
    - Two types of tags
        1. Non self-closing tags
            - Opening tag
                - `<p>`
            - Closing tag
                - `</p>`
        2. Self-closing tags
            - `<img src="http://mywebsite.com/cat.jpg">`
    - HTML Attributes
        - Define the metadata for a particular HTML element
        - Key-value pairs
        - Global attributes
            - `style`
            - `class`
                - A particular value can be used for multiple elements
            - `id`
                - A particular value can be used for only a single element (unique)
        - Other attributes
            - `src`
            - `rel`
            - etc.
    - Common HTML elements
        - Heading
            - `h1` through `h6`
        - Paragraph
            - `p`
        - Image
            - `img`
        - Boilerplate elements
            - `html`
            - `body`
            - `head`
        - General elements
            - `div`
                - Block element
            - `span`
                - Inline element
    - Block element
        - Takes up the entire width of the parent's content space
    - Inline element
        - Only takes up as much width as necessary
    - Semantic v. Nonsemantic elements
        - Semantic: clearly communicates its meaning to the browser AND developers reading the HTML
            - `article`
            - `aside`
            - `details`
            - `footer`
            - `header`
            - `main`
            - `nav`
            - `section`
            - Are typically block level elements and behave the same as a div
        - Non-semantic: does not clearly communicate what the element's meaning/purpose is
            - `div`
            - `span`
* CSS
    - Ways to include CSS
        - Inline
            - style attribute of an HTML element
                - `<p style="color: red;">`
        - Internal
            - `<style></style>` element nested in `head` tag
            - Define CSS using same syntax as external
        - External
            - External .css file
            - Use `<link rel="stylesheet" href="mycssfile.css" />` to utilize a .css file
    - Syntax
        - `#my-id p { color: red; background-color: blue; }`
            - `<selector> { <css property>: <property value>; <css property 2>: <property value> }`
        - Consists of "declarations"
            - `<css property>: value`
        - The curly braces `{}` is a declaration block
        - `#my-id p` is an example of a combination selector (descendant selector)
            - "Select p tags that are children of an element with an id of my-id"
    - Selectors
        - `*`: universal
        - `#id`: id
        - `.class`: class
        - `div p`: descendant selector
    - CSS Precedence (highest to lowest)
        - Inline (style attribute)
        - #id
        - .class
        - Tag name
        - Universal
    - CSS inheritance
        - Some properties are inherited from parent element, but not all
        - Typically, it's the text related styling that is inherited such as `color` or `font-size`
    - CSS Box Model
        - Content
            - The actual content itself
                - Text
                - Child elements
        - Padding
            - Space between content and border
        - Border
            - The section that demarcates where the element "ends"
        - Margin
            - The space between the element and other elements
        - Note: Content + Padding are part of the "fill-area", or the area where background color and background images can be applied
    * CSS Flexbox
        - A way to produce layouts for the webpage
        - 1 Dimensional (1D)
        - Elements are aligned along the main axis
            - By default, the main axis is horizontal but can be made vertical
    * CSS Grid
        - A way to produce layouts for the webpage
        - 2 Dimensional (2D)
        - Elements can be placed within the 2D grid
* JavaScript
    - A programming language that can be used in
        1. Servers (usually with node.js)
        2. Web browsers
            - DOM Manipulation to add/remove/modify HTML elements from the DOM
            - Fetch API to send HTTP requests and receive data back
            - Chrome uses the V8 engine to run JavaScript
    - Traditionally interpreted, but also has some ability to be compiled
    - High-level, multi-paradigm, interpreted language
    - Including JS
        - Internal
            - Put JS code between `<script></script>` tags
        - External
            - Use `<script src="myjsfile.js></script>`
                - `src` attribute to specify external js file
        - Script tag should either be placed at the BOTTOM of the `body` element or in the `head` with a `defer` attribute
    - Variable declaration types
        - `var`
            - Two possible scopes
                - global
                - function
            - hoisted
        - `let`
            - Three possible scopes
                - global
                - function
                - block
            - NOT hoisted
        - `const`
            - Is a constant (cannot be given a new value)
            - Three possible scopes
                - global
                - function
                - block
            - NOT hoisted
    - Datatypes
        - number
        - string
        - boolean
        - null
        - undefined
        - object
    - Functions
        - Reusable blocks of code that can be executed over and over again
        - Take inputs (parameters)
        - Produce outputs (return)
        - 3 types
            - Named functions
                - `function myFunc() {}`
            - Anonymous functions
                - Don't have a name
                - `function() {}`
            - Arrow functions
                - Don't have a name
                - `() => {}`
                - The `this` keyword is based on the `this` keyword's value within the lexical scope that the arrow function was defined within
    - Objects
        - Similar to dictionaries in Python
        - Composed of key-value pairs
        - Ways to create an object
            - `{}` Object literal syntax
            - Function constructors
            - Classes (ES6)
    - JS Arrays
        - Similar to lists in Python
        - Indexed starting at 0
        - Length of a list can be retrieved using `.length` property
        - Methods
            - `push` to add to end of an array
            - `pop` to remove from end of an array
            - `unshift` to add to the beginning of an array
            - `shift` to remove from the beginning of an array
    - DOM Manipulation
        - DOM: Document object model
            - HTML elements are modelled as `nodes` in a tree
            - Parent nodes connect to child nodes
            - The root element of the tree is the `document` object
        - Selecting elements
            - `document.getElementById('myid')`
            - `document.getElementsByName('myname')`
            - `document.getElementsByTagName('p')`
            - `document.getElementsByClassName('myclass')`
            - `document.querySelector('#myid p')`
                - Provides ability to use CSS selectors to select elements from DOM
                - Gets the first occurrence
            - `document.querySelectorAll('#myid p')`
                - Provides ability to use CSS selectors to select elements from DOM
                - Returns a collection of elements that match
    - Events
        - "Things" that happen to HTML elements
            - `click`
            - `load`
            - `keydown`
            - `keyup`
            - `mouseover`
            - `mouseout`
            - etc
        - Can select an element from the DOM and add an event listener to it
            - `let myElement = document.getElementById('myelementid')`
            - `myElement.addEventListener('click', myCallbackFunction)`
        - Event listener: is attached to a particular element and listens for events to occur on that element
            - When event occurs, callback function is invoked
        - Callback function: A function that is passed into a function as an argument and called at a later point in the future
        - Bubbling and Capturing
            - Events are not isolated to the target element on which a particular event occurred
            - Two phases
                1. Capturing: first phase
                2. Bubbling: second phase
            - An event starts out at the root element (`html`) and works its way down to the target element (capturing phase)
            - Once event reaches the target element, it works its way back up to each parent until it reaches the `html` element again (bubbling phase)
            - By default, event listeners listen for events while they're in the **bubbling** phase
    - Promise
        - Introduced in ES6
        - Is a "promise" that a value will be "produced" in the future
        - 3 states
            - Pending
            - Fulfilled: value is successfully produced
            - Rejected: error value is produced
        - A promise either moves from `pending to fulfilled` or `pending to rejected`
        - Handling promises
            - `.then((data) => {})` amd `.catch((err) => {})`
                - Both accept a callback function with a defined parameter
                - If promise succeeds, .then()'s callback function is executed and the value provided to that function
                - If promise rejects, .catch()'s callback function is executed and the error value provided to that function  
            - `async-await`
                - `async function myAsyncFunc() {}`
                    - Async function can utilize `await`
                    - Async functions wrap their return value into a promise as well if needed to return something
                - Await
                    - Used to wait on a promise for its `fulfilled` value
                    - ex. `let res = await fetch(...)` 
                    - `let data = await res.json()`
                    - Pauses the async function until promise that it is awaiting is fulfilled or rejected
    - Fetch API
        - Browser API to send HTTP requests
        - Utilizes `fetch()` function
